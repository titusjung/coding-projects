GRADING CRITERIA AND TEST CASES

Check the following the following scenarios. If the program fails a task, mark off the associated point values. It is essential report the test number and a small description of what went wrong to the student on blackboard. This way, they may go back and check for themselves. If at any point, you cannot perform a test, you may list the test number, and the total for the test and “Incomplete” as the description.

Category and % of Grade	Criteria	KEY
File I/O 0.75%		
0.1% - 	Reads in high-scores.	A
0.2% - 	Reads in battleship map.	B
0.2% -	Hard files are handled correctly.	C
0.25% - 	Outputs correct update to file when a high-score is made.	D

0.3% - 	Layout/formatting resembles the samples shown.	I
Game 0.75%		
0.1% - 	The game only accepts valid input.	J
0.35% - 	The game responds correctly to ships being hit/sunk.	K
0.3% - 	The game board updates correctly on each valid move.	L

Before testing: Drag and drop the provided test files into the src/ folder of the student’s assignment.

Note to students: We used the exact .txt file given to you as a sample to test basic features of your program. 


Test 1:
Run the program, and enter “src/A2Test1.txt”
Try to resize the window.
Inspect the title of the window.
After the window pops up, exit it by clicking the X on the window.
•	The window is resizable -0.033% (E)
•	The window is not labeled. – 0.034% (E)
•	The window does not close from the ‘X’ -0.033% (E)
Total: 0.1%

Test 2:
Re-run the program, enter “src/A2Test1.txt”
Inspect the grid.
Inspect the high-scores table.
•	The grid is not 10x10, or is not formatted correctly -0.1%(F)
•	The grid does not include labels -0.1%(F)
•	There is no high-scores board to the right of the game board -0.2%(G)
Total: 0.4%

Test 3:
Re-run the program, enter “src/A2Test2.txt”
Make sure the high-scores table corresponds with the new file.
Type in coordinates
A1,A2,A3,A4,A5
B1,B2
C2,C3
D1,D2,D3
E5,E6,E7,E8
You should notice the ships are uncovered correspond to the text file.
You should also notice messages as ships are uncovered/sunk.
You should also notice the game board update graphically with each move.
•	The correct high-scores were not read in from A2Test2.txt -0.1% (A)
•	The correct map was not read in from A2Test2.txt -0.1% (B)
•	The game did not respond correctly to ships being hit/sunk. -0.15% (K)
•	The game board updates graphically on each move -0.15% (L)
Total: 0.5%

Test 4:
Re-run the program, enter “src/A2Test1.txt”
Go ahead and type in the following coordinates to win the game:
A6, A7, A8, A9
C3, C4, C5, C6, C7
E5, F5
G3, H3, I3
I5, I6
You should notice the ships are uncovered correspond to the text file.
You should also notice messages as ships are uncovered/sunk.
You should also notice the game board update graphically with each move.
Enter your name as ‘Grader’. You should get 1st place.
You should see the win-screen at the end with the correct information.
•	The game did not respond correctly to ships being hit/sunk. -0.2% (K)
•	The game board updates graphically on each move -0.15% (L)
•	The correct map was not read in from A2Test1.txt -0.1% (B)
•	The end screen does not display a thank you message -0.05% (H)
•	The end screen does not display the individual’s score -0.05% (H)
•	The end screen does not display the updated leaderboard -0.1% (H)
Total: 0.6.5%

Test 5:
Re-run the program, enter “src/A2Test1.txt”
You should see the updated leaderboard with ‘Grader’
Enter the coordinates A1,A1 You should get a message warning that it was a repeat.
Enter the coordinates 72-G You should get a message warning that it was an invalid coordinate.
•	The leaderboard was not updated from previous games. -0.25% (D)
•	On repeated moves, the game counter increased -0.05% (J)
•	The game could not handle invalid coordinate entry -0.05% (J)
Total: 0.35%

Test 6:
Re-run the program, enter “src/A2Test3.txt”.
The program should not accept this, and not crash.
Re-run the program, enter “src/A2Test4.txt”.
The program should accept this, and not crash check A1 A2 B1 B2. These should be destroyers. The positioning of the ships don’t matter. (A1/B1)&(A2/B2) VS (A1/A2)&(B1/B2) either is fine.
•	The invalid file was accepted, or crashed the program -0.1% (C)
•	The tricky Battleship configuration file was not handled. – 0.1% (C)
Total: 0.1%

Test 6:
Reflect on the visual appearance of the program.
Pick one:
•	The layout of the components made the program impossible to use. -0.3% (I)
•	The layout of the components looked messy. -0.2% (I)
•	The layout of the components looked slightly off. -0.1% (I)
Total: 0.3%

Note: This is a bit subjective – be forgiving. Most students should get full credit.
“Impossible to use” – Components are hidden or so out of place it is difficult to find them.
“Messy” – Minimal effort was put into the entire layout.
“Slightly off” – One or two components were out of place.
